lazy-random - a fast rng-pipe.


lazy-random generates cryptographical strong pseudo-random numbers using
AES in counter-mode.
We have to care about the fact that in counter-mode no block-value will
be repeated. So, to prevent statistical attacks, we rekey every 16Mb.

For the rekeying-process it is assumed that cryptographical strong
random numbers are available via stdin, e.g.

  $ </dev/urandom lazy-random

This program uses the crypto++-library (http://cryptopp.com). Thank you
guys. You're awesome!
